Hi, I'm building a portfolio site to gain more web dev experience and to list off things like my education, ecperience and projects. In the future I plan to add things like a blog to this site, stay tuned for future updates.

## Credit

Followed this [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12ZeRqf5CQE) from **How To Web Dev** on youtube to get started, then added more things such as a navigation menu, blog, contact page, etc.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
